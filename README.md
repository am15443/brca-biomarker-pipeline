# Cross-Study Transcriptomic Intelligence

### A distributed big-data pipeline for safety-aware cancer drug-target discovery

A horizontally-scalable pipeline that screens public tumor and healthy-tissue
RNA-sequencing data to rank drug targets by both **efficacy** (up-regulated in
tumor) and **safety** (quiet in healthy tissue). Built on Apache Spark, Hadoop
HDFS/YARN, Spark MLlib, and MongoDB, running on Google Cloud Dataproc. Data is
drawn from [recount3](https://rna.recount.bio/) (uniformly-processed TCGA tumor
and GTEx healthy-tissue RNA-seq).

## The core result

Two collagen genes make the case for the whole approach:

| Gene | log2 fold-change in tumor | Expression in healthy breast | Verdict |
|------|---------------------------|------------------------------|---------|
| **COL10A1** | +5.39 (strongly up) | 0.37 log2-CPM (silent) | **Candidate** |
| **COL1A1** | +2.41 (up) | 8.90 log2-CPM (abundant) | **Toxicity risk** |

Both are up in tumor, so an efficacy-only analysis would flag both. The safety
axis separates them. Extended across six cancers, the top recurring candidates
form a **pan-cancer proliferation signature** (HJURP, ASF1B, CDT1, CDC20, BIRC5,
UBE2C, ...) -- cell-division genes that are safe-to-target across five of six
tumor types.

## Architecture

| Tier | Technology | Function |
|------|-----------|----------|
| **Storage** | recount3 (AWS S3) -> HDFS, Parquet | Ingest raw counts; store columnar, partitioned |
| **Processing** | Apache Spark (Spark SQL) | Normalize; differential expression across 63,856 genes |
| **Modeling** | Spark MLlib | Truncated SVD; Random Forest classifier |
| **Serving** | MongoDB Atlas | One indexed document per gene-cancer record |

## Data

| Cancer (TCGA) | Tumor / Normal | Matched healthy (GTEx) |
|---------------|----------------|------------------------|
| BRCA (breast) | 1,127 / 112 | BREAST |
| LUAD (lung) | 540 / 59 | LUNG |
| THCA (thyroid) | 505 / 59 | THYROID |
| PRAD (prostate) | 505 / 52 | PROSTATE |
| COAD (colon) | 503 / 41 | COLON |
| KIRC (kidney) | 543 / 72 | KIDNEY |

~7,100 samples, 63,856 genes each, hundreds of millions of expression rows.
All public, all uniformly processed by recount3 (no batch-effect correction or
acquisition cost).

## Pipeline scripts

Run in order. Spark jobs use `spark-submit --master yarn`; plotting/serving
scripts use `python3`. Data is staged in HDFS under `/user/<user>/biomarker/`.
Scripts 02, 03, 05, 06 are parameterized by cancer/tissue.

| # | Script | Type | What it does |
|---|--------|------|--------------|
| 02 | `02_tcga_to_parquet.py <CANCER>` | Spark | Reshape TCGA matrix to long-format Parquet + labels |
| 03 | `03_diffexp_ttest_v2.py <CANCER>` | Spark | Differential expression: CPM/log2, Welch t-test, BH-FDR |
| 04 | `04_volcano.py` | local | Volcano plot |
| 05 | `05_gtex_to_parquet_param.py <TISSUE>` | Spark | Reshape GTEx healthy tissue to long-format Parquet |
| 06 | `06_target_score.py <CANCER>` | Spark | Join efficacy + safety; z-score; target score + verdict |
| 07 | `07_target_scatter.py` | local | Efficacy-vs-safety quadrant scatter |
| 08 | `08_benchmark.py` | Spark | Time the DE workload at 10/25/50/75/100% of data |
| 09 | `09_benchmark_plot.py` | local | Runtime-vs-size plot + corpus extrapolation |
| 10 | `10_combine_svd.py [N_GENES]` | Spark | Union all 12 datasets; top-variable genes; truncated SVD |
| 11 | `11_pca_plot.py` | Spark | PCA projection: by tissue and by tumor/healthy |
| 12 | `12_pca_pc3.py` | Spark | PC1-PC2 vs PC1-PC3 tissue separation |
| 13b | `13b_classifier_svd.py` | Spark | Random Forest tumor-vs-healthy on SVD features |
| 14 | `14_mongo_load_all.py` | local | Load all six cancers into MongoDB (one doc per gene-cancer) |
| 15 | `15_mongo_query.py [SYMBOL]` | local | Single-gene lookup + ranked demo queries |

## Key results

- **Differential expression** recovers textbook breast-cancer genes (COL10A1,
  MMP11, proliferation markers) -- validating correctness. Statistics validated
  against `scipy` and `statsmodels` to numerical precision.
- **Target scoring** across six cancers: 123,092 gene-cancer records; a
  pan-cancer proliferation signature recurs across five of six cancers.
- **Unsupervised SVD/PCA** recovers tissue identity and a tumor-vs-healthy axis
  across all six cancers, using no labels.
- **Classifier** predicts tumor vs. healthy at 85.9% accuracy (AUC 0.857) on the
  50 SVD components.
- **Scalability**: near-linear, 1.38 s per million rows; extrapolates to ~18 h
  for the full ~48-billion-row corpus on this cluster (~2 h on a 10x cluster).

## Method notes

**Why a t-test, not DESeq2.** DESeq2's negative-binomial GLM is the field
standard but is unavailable in Spark MLlib and does not shard cleanly. At these
sample sizes, Welch's t-test on log-CPM agrees with count-based methods on the
top differentially-expressed genes. The focus of this project is distributed
computation at scale.

**Why SVD features for the classifier.** A gene-level Random Forest (2,000
features) exhausted executor memory on the shared cluster. Training on the 50
SVD components was fast and stable -- dimensionality reduction as a systems-level
enabler for ML on constrained infrastructure.

**Scope.** The target score is a screening heuristic that flags candidates for
review; it does not declare drug targets. Real target selection also folds in
genetic evidence, druggability, and pathway context.
